        One day, a mighty lion was sleeping peacefully in the jungle when a small
        mouse accidentally ran across his paw. The lion woke up angrily and
        captured the tiny mouse in his large claws.

      <p>
        The frightened mouse begged the lion to spare his life, promising that
        he would return the favor someday. The lion laughed at the idea of such
        a small creature helping him, but he decided to let the mouse go.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, the lion was caught in a hunter’s net and could not escape.
        Hearing his roar, the mouse came to help and gnawed through the ropes
        until the lion was free. The lion realized that even the smallest friend
        can be a great help.
